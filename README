Memoize-Expire-ByInstance

Memoize::Expire::ByInstance is intended for object oriented perl coders who
have on occasion a need to both Memoize a method so that when invoked on any
instance the benefit of memoization can be had, while simultaniously wanting
to provide expiration of the memoization with per-instance lifetimes/num-uses
granularity. 

Say for instance you were working on utility classes that utilized a
semi-generic web-interface client class, and wanted to reduce the load on the
HTTP servers by caching identical queries.

For many types of queries, you could stand to use data that is somewhat old;
however for some types of queries, you always needed "fresh" data.

You have a generic 'query' class, that you use for all the low-level
gruntwork of performing the RPC itself. 

Because the Utility classes could be used in any permutation in a resulting 
utilities (or other classes), you have know way of assigning a reasonable
'default' timeout for the client class, instead you hope that whomever writes
the utility classes will set an appropriate expiration policy, and provide
accessors to adjust their defaults on a case-by-case basis.

Memoize::Expire::ByInstance allows you to implement for that use-case just as
easily as you would for any other Memoization. Simply tie the hash you
use for the Memoization Cache to Memoize::Expire::ByInstance, and now every
instance can decide for themselves how old is "too" old.

This ensure that you never break assumptions globally about the 'freshness' of
the memoized methods, while still reaping all the benefits of memoization when
caching is appropriate. 

This module requires Perl 5.6.2 or later.
